# Community Collabs

## **HEADS UP**
These projects have moved to their own individual repositories:

- [Cda's Morph](https://github.com/cda94581/cdas-morph)
- [Open Source Chunk Loaders](https://github.com/cda94581/open-source-chunk-loaders)
- [3rd Life Add-on](https://github.com/cda94581/3rd-life-add-on)

### Why?
Mostly for easier organization of projects. Having multiple projects condensed into one repository resulted in inconveniences and disorganization when it comes to managing and separating stuff, especially issues and bugs.

Another thing is the planned move to put all releases on Github, making for a much nicer end-user experience when compared with Mediafire. I'd also like to setup more workflows and just make everything much more optimized.

Until further notice, this repository is becoming a public archive.
